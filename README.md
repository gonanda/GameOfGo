# Game of Go: AI using the Benson's algorithm

The aim of this project is to train a bot to play the game of go at human level using reinforcement learning on artificial neural networks. We used different optimization methods in order to improve the data training. We implemented aditional rules of the game with help of Benson's algorithm. 

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.7
* Python libraries: TensowFlow 1.14.0, Keras 2.2.4
